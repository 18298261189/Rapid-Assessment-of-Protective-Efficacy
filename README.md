# Rapid-Assessment-of-Protective-Efficacy
A composite predictive framework (Neutralizing Antibody–Genetic Distance–Vaccine Efficacy model) for evaluating COVID-19 vaccine protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, with application to heterologous prime-boost regimens.
This repository provides the full R code and data analysis workflow used in our study on predicting vaccine efficacy (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 variants.
The framework integrates neutralizing antibody waning, genetic distance of variants, and statistical modeling to estimate protection levels, perform internal/external validation, and visualize protection persistence.
